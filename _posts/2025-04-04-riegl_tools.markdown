[Riegl Tools](https://gitlab.com/jrsrp/sys/lidar/riegl_tools) has been updated to 
work with numpy 2.0. This package allows reading of data in Riegl's RDBX and RXP
formats (produced from a Riegl TLS scan) into structured numpy arrays for further
processing.
See the [homepage](https://gitlab.com/jrsrp/sys/lidar/riegl_tools) for more
information.
