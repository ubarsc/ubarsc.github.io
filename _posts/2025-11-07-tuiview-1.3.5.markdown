[TuiView](https://tuiview.org/) 1.3.5 has been released. This release adds one
new feature - the ability to "lock" layers so they remain on top. This is 
especially handy for vector layers.

In addition, there were a number of fixes. For more information see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).
