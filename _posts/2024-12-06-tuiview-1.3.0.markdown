TuiView 2.0.3 has been released. The major thing in this release
is that the GUI toolkit has been shifted from PyQt5/Qt5 to 
PySide6/Qt6. This has required many changes to the code so 
caution should be excerised when upgrading. 
The ability to copy the display directly to the clipboard has
also been added. See the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/blob/master/CHANGES.txt)
for more information.
