[TuiView](https://tuiview.org/) 1.3.4 has been released. This is a bugfix release
that fixes an issue with selecting by expression in the RAT. There is also a fix
for a problem introduced in 1.3.2 that can lead to files with a large RAT taking
a long time to load.

In addition to these fixes, the requirement for files to have their `LAYER_TYPE` metadata item 
set to `thematic` before they are treated as thematic by TuiView has been removed. They
now just need to have a RAT with colour columns or a colour table set before they are
treated as thematic. This brings TuiView more in line with other software.
