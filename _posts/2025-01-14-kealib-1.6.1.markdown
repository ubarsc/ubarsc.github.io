[kealib](https://kealib.org/) 1.6.1 has been released. This is mainly a bug fix release.
Memory leaks have been resolved in the Python bindings, and performance of building neighbours
in Python has been improved. There has also been a fix to libkea to ensure neighbours are
flushed properly to file.
For more information see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/kealib/blob/master/Changes.txt).
