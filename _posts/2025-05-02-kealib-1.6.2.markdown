[kealib](https://kealib.org/) 1.6.2 has been released. This is a minor a bug fix release.
This addresses a problem where Raster Attribute Table updates wheren't always written 
straight to file. Changes used to be written when the table object was destroyed but
this appears to not happen reliably with later GDAL. This could cause file corruption
when you re-open the KEA file later in the same script.
This release also updates the `cmake` build for recent versions of `cmake` and bumps
the minimum required version.
