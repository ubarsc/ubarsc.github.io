[TuiView](https://tuiview.org/) 1.3.2 has been released. This is a larger major release than normal
and includes such features as:

* Support for colour tables in thematic images. Previously only colour tables within the Raster Attribute
Table were used, but some formats prefer colour tables (which are dealt with separately by GDAL).
* Export selected RAT rows from the Query Window as .csv
* Improved stretch window - stretch parameters can be varied by band. Also stretch can be copy and pasted between windows.
* Support for RGBA images.

For more information see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).

```
Be careful exporting .stretch files - those using the new stretch 
window features may not be compatible with older versions of TuiView.
```
