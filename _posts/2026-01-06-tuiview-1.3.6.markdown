[TuiView](https://tuiview.org/) 1.3.6 has been released. This release overhauls
the plugin mechanism so all dockable windows can now have plugins registered. 
See the [wiki page](https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/wiki/Plugins) for more
information. 
In addition, the "Save Viewer State" functionality now supports periodic saves
at a user specified interval. 
An imports box is now available when selecting RAT rows by an expression or
updating a column by an expression. This allows the user to access other
funcionality in packages they have installed.

Also, there were a number of fixes. For more information see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/tuiview/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).
