The latest kealib (1.6.0) has improved threadsafety and increased default internal
chunksizes which may improve performance reading files on /vsis3 and /vsicurl 
filesystems.
Also fixes an issue with overview writing on the fly with RIOS 2.0.5 and the internal GDAL driver.
This release *may* cause ABI breakage so it is suggested that users recompile anything
linked to kealib when upgrading.
For more information see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ubarsc/kealib/blob/master/Changes.txt).
